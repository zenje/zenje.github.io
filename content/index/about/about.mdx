In 2015, I graduated from the [University of California, Irvine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine) with a B.S. in Computer Science. After graduating, I worked as a full-stack developer at [Veeva Systems](https://www.veeva.com/) for four years, using Java and JavaScript to build features for a cloud-based web platform.

In 2021, I returned to California after traveling and living in Asia for almost two years. During that time, I saw many incredible sights and talked to people from all around the world, and even lived with just a backpack’s worth of things for over a year.

These days, I’ve been dabbling around with React and learning about other front-end technologies. Apart from programming, I enjoy art, reading, traveling, practicing Chinese, and jumping around from hobby to hobby to whatever interests me.

I hope to do some good in this world while I’m here.
